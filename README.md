Collecting data from and "replicating" this tweet thread: https://twitter.com/JohnFPfaff/status/1378572992024821763

Data from https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2020-and-2019-Year-End-Final.pdf,
except for the coding of progressive DA, which is from John Pfaff's tweets.

Interact with this data by clicking the pretty Launch Binder link below, opening the `MMCA_data.ipynb` Jupyter notebook (click on the text of its name), and e.g. clicking `Kernel` menu, `Restart and Run All`.
